1. The main game UI shows a screen with a set of fixed locations ("holes") where objects
("moles") can spawn.
2. During gameplay, moles appear and disappear at random holes over time. Moles do not
spawn at a hole that is occupied by another mole.
3. The rate at which moles appear and disappear increases over time as the game is
played.
4. Tapping on a mole causes it to disappear and increases the player's score by some
amount. Tapping on a hole when no mole is visible has no effect.
5. The game ends when the player has missed (i.e. failed to tap on) a certain number of
moles.
6. The player's score is shown in the main game UI and updated as it changes. After the
game is over, the player is shown their final score.
7. The highest score achieved in a game is stored and persists between opening/closing
the app (i.e. persists on disk).
8. The current high score is displayed somewhere in the main game UI.
9. The game plays sound effects when a mole appears and when a mole is tapped.
